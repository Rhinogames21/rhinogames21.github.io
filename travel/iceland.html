                <h3 class="attraction">Skaftafell Ice Cave</h3>
           
                <p class="color-2">In the south of the country, Vatnajökull National Park is a land of glaciers and magnificent ice caves, which attract adventurers from across the globe. The vast national park (one of three in Iceland) is divided into four sections and consists of Vatnajökull glacier and its surroundings. </p>
                <p class="color-2">You'll find a number of visitor centers; those in Skaftafell Ice Cave and Höfn are open year-round, while Skriðuklaustur and Jökulsárgljúfur are closed in winter. The best time to visit Skaftafell Ice Cave is during winter after heavy rain has washed the top layer of the glacier away.</p>
                
                <p class="color-2">If seen at the right time, the cave is bathed in spectacular blue light. Group visits to all areas can be arranged off-season. If you are in healthy shape, you might consider doing a glacial trek with an experienced guide. The treks get you on the ice for an unforgettable experience to see glacial cracks and caves and even drink fresh water from small pools on the surface.</p>

                <h3 class="attraction">Blue Lagoon</h3>
                
                <p class="color-2">Just 40 minutes' drive from Reykjavík, this most iconic of geothermal spas is a must-see tourist attraction. Here, you'll find natural bathing in pale blue water in the shadow of a power station.</p>
                <p class="color-2">An entire Blue Lagoon industry has grown around this attraction since it first became a hit with locals in 1976. The water from the underground hot springs reaches 37-39 degrees Celsius and is said to be highly beneficial for both health and skin.</p>
                <p class="color-2">If the die-hard Icelanders are anything to go by, don't knock the theory. Aside from bathing in a unique setting, there's a shop selling skincare products, a range of spa treatments, and places to eat and drink. Don't visit Iceland without coming here.</p>
