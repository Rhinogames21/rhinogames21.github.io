                <p class="color-2">History, culture, and natural beauty perhaps best describe the essence of vacationing in Germany. With its many historic cities and small towns, along with an abundance of forests and mountains, visitors are spoiled for choice when it comes to choosing a unique place to visit.</p>

                <h3 class="attraction">Neuschwanstein Castle</h3>
            
                <p class="color-2">The quaint old town of Füssen, situated between the Ammergau and Allgäu Alps and a popular alpine resort and winter sports center, is a good base from which to explore nearby Neuschwanstein Castle, one of Europe's most famous (and picturesque) royal castles.</p>
                
                <p class="color-2">King Ludwig II of Bavaria built this many-towered and battlement-covered fantasy fortress - the inspiration for Walt Disney's famous theme park castles - from 1869-86. A variety of tour options are offered, including guided tours of the sumptuous interior taking in the Throne Room, the Singers' Hall... and some of the country's most spectacular views.</p>

                <h3 class="attraction">Brandenburg Gate</h3>
                
                <img src="static/g2.jpg" class="float-right md" alt="Brandenburg gate in Berlin">
                
                <p class="color-2">Modeled on the Acropolis in Athens and built for King Frederick William II in 1791, the monumental sandstone Brandenburg Gate in Berlin's Mitte district was the city's first Neoclassical structure. It measures an impressive 26 meters in height, including the Quadriga, the spectacular four-horse chariot carrying the goddess of victory perched atop.</p>

                <p class="color-2">Its six huge columns on each side of the structure form five impressive passages: four were used by regular traffic, while the center was reserved for the royal carriages. Huge Doric columns also decorate the two buildings at each side of the Gate, once used by toll-collectors and guards.</p>

                <p class="color-2">Undoubtedly Berlin's most iconic structure, it's hard to believe that the majestic structure you see today was severely damaged during WWII and was also once part of the infamous Berlin Wall and, for a few decades, was symbolic of the division of Berlin into East and West.</p>
